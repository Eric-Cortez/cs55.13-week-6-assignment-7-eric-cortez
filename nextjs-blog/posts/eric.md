I kicked off this little blog to practice static site generation with Next.js and to keep notes on what I learn week to week. The goal is to keep posts short and focused so I can ship something daily without overthinking it.

I’ll iterate on the UI later. For now, I’m wiring up data fetching, dynamic routes, and some basic components like a `<Date />` formatter to make posts readable.
