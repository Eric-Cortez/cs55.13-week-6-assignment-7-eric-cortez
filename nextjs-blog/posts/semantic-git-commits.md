I started using semantic prefixes (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, perf, test) and it’s surprising how much clarity they add to the history. Skimming the log now gives me a narrative of the project’s evolution.

This also pairs well with automated release tooling. Even if you don’t automate, consistent messages make code reviews and retros a lot easier.
