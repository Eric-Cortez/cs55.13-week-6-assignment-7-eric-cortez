I added a simple pull request template today and it immediately made my review process smoother. For small projects, it’s easy to skip good descriptions and testing notes—templates nudge you to include the essentials.

My template sections are: summary, changes, screenshots, testing steps, and risks. Even a minimal checklist reduces back-and-forth and surfaces edge cases before merge.
